# This decorator transforms the function that follows into an endpoint. 
# We use the .route() instance method from our Blueprint instance.

#  Together these arguments define what type of request will be routed to this function. 
# The first argument defines the path (or URL) of the request and the second argument defines a list of HTTP methods (or verbs) the request could have.
# @blueprint_name.route("/endpoint/path/here", methods=["GET"])

# This function will execute whenever a request that matches the decorator is received. 
# The function can be named whatever feels most appropriate.
# def endpoint_name():

    # We must define a response body to return. 
    # Here, we're using a local variable my_beautiful_response_body to hold a value
#     my_beautiful_response_body = "Hello, World!"
    # For each endpoint, we must return the HTTP response.
    # Give a response 200 OK with the HTTP body "Hello, World!"
    #  If we don't set the status code ourselves, Flask will use 200 OK by default.

    # return my_beautiful_response_body
